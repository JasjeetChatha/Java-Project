JAVA Project
Student Grade Book

Jasjeet Singh Chatha













Project Overview:
The Student Gradebook is a JavaFX application designed for teachers to manage their students' grades. The program provides a graphical interface for teachers to add and delete students, modify student grades, and generate student grade reports.  The application requires the teacher to log in with correct credentials before accessing any student data. Teachers can add students and enter their midterm and final exam grades. The program automatically calculates the total percentage based on these grades, which determines whether the student passes or fails.  Additionally, students can use the application to view their own grades, but they cannot make any changes to the data.  The application utilizes dynamic arrays and file I/O to store and manage student and grade data. Overall, the Student Gradebook provides an efficient and user-friendly way for teachers to manage their students' grades.
Functionality:
The Student Gradebook program provides the following functionalities:
Login Screen:
The program provides a login screen that allows users to choose to log in as a teacher or student.
 

Teacher View:
Once logged in as a teacher, the program provides access to a screen where the teacher can add or delete students, and view or modify student grade data.

 
if the username and password is valid then only teacher can login in this. Additionally, we have a  back button here to go back to login page.
 
we can observe that there is text area for all the details about student which include student ID Student Name, Midterm marks, final, total marks and result. It have some buttons too which includes Add student, Edit Student and logout.
 
we have text field where teacher have to enter the student id of the student for editing the details for particular student.
 
we have text fields and labels for student details where teacher could edit them.

 
While exiting from the main menu of students it will ask you again for exit.


Student View:
Once logged in as a student, the program provides access to a screen where the student can view their own student information and grades.
 
While logging in as student, it will ask for student ID and you can directly login in into the window.

 
After logging in the student window it will display the details of student.
 
Marks i.e., if they passed or failed.
Dynamic Arrays:
The program uses dynamic arrays, specifically ArrayList, to store the student and grade data. This allows for efficient management and manipulation of the data, such as adding or deleting a student or modifying student grades.

File I/O:
The program uses file I/O to store the student and grade data to a file. This ensures that the data is not lost when the program is closed or restarted.

Overall, the Student Gradebook program is an effective tool for teachers to manage their students' grades. The program's intuitive GUI and use of dynamic arrays and file I/O make it easy for teachers to view, manage, and store student and grade data.

Conclusion:
Jasjeet: During this project, I learned how to use JavaFX to create a graphical user interface for an application. It was challenging to understand the concepts and implement them, but with practice and help from my team members, I was able to overcome the difficulties. One thing I would do differently in the future is to spend more time planning and discussing the project requirements with my team members before starting to code. This would have saved us some time and effort in the long run. 
 Working on this project taught me how to collaborate with other developers on a team and work towards a common goal. It was challenging to integrate all the different components of the application, but we were able to overcome the difficulties by communicating effectively and breaking down the tasks into smaller parts. In the future, I would like to improve my coding skills and become more proficient in JavaFX so that I can contribute more to the project. 
This project was a great learning experience for me as it helped me understand the importance of planning and organizing the project requirements before starting to code. It was challenging to manage the dynamic arrays and file I/O operations, but I learned a lot from my team members and was able to improve my coding skills. In the future, I would like to work on improving my debugging skills and become more proficient in JavaFX.
